# SystemPulse Optimizer

SystemPulse Optimizer is a professional, cross-platform system optimization tool for
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

It focuses on real, transparent, and reversible optimizations — not fake "boosts".

--------------------------------------------------

KEY FEATURES

- Full system scan with detailed results
- 75+ real system optimizations (platform-specific)
- Category-based fixes:
  - Performance
  - Memory
  - Disk & Storage
  - Startup
  - Power
  - Privacy
- Gaming / FPS optimization mode (session-based, auto-revert)
- Advanced Mode with clear risk levels (SAFE -> CRITICAL)
- Automatic backups and one-click undo
- Timeline of all system changes
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- No background services
- No telemetry
- No fake performance claims

--------------------------------------------------

GAMING MODE (IMPORTANT NOTES)

Gaming optimizations are:
- Session-only
- Automatically reverted
- CPU, scheduler, and memory focused

GPU-limited games may not see FPS gains.
SystemPulse Optimizer does not modify drivers or apply unsafe kernel tweaks.

--------------------------------------------------

SAFETY & TRANSPARENCY

- Every optimization shows:
  - What will change
  - Risk level
  - Whether a restart is required
- Backups are created before risky changes
- Undo is available for all supported operations
- Advanced optimizations require explicit user confirmation

SystemPulse Optimizer never hides actions or applies changes silently.

--------------------------------------------------

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

- Windows 10 / 11
- Modern Linux distributions
- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)

Administrator / sudo permissions are requested only when required and always explained.
